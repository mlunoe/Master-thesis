\chapter{Preface}
%Time spent on assembling playlists for certain purposes often exceeds the actual use. Some automatic playlist generation engines already exists, but they often lack the possibility of altering the generated playlist - or the option of specifying the length. The result is a repeated query for a playlist until one satisfies and another when it runs out of songs to play.
%
%This thesis is the product of a personal need for an Automatic Playlist Generator.
%
%The thesis is produced under the Department of Informatics and Mathematical Modelling at the Technical University of Denmark and it will presume some knowledge of logic programming and functional programming as it will include an implementation of a program in each language. The preconditions for the thesis are the courses 02156 Formal Logical Systems and 02157 Functional programming taught at the Technical University of Denmark.
