\noindent I would like to thank my family and friends for support and review of the thesis. I would also like to thank my counsellors, Michael Kai Petersen and Carsten Witt from the Department of Informatics and Mathematical Modelling at the Technical University of Denmark, for giving me room for my own definition of the thesis. Also for review of the process and guidance in the right direction.
