\chapter*{Preface}
Many digital newspapers present their content and navigation based on the scanning behaviour readers have on the web, but they do not consider the more in-depth reading tablet computers attract from their users.
%Time spent on assembling playlists for certain purposes often exceeds the actual use. Some automatic playlist generation engines already exists, but they often lack the possibility of altering the generated playlist - or the option of specifying the length. The result is a repeated query for a playlist until one satisfies and another when it runs out of songs to play.

This paper is the product of a personal need for a digital newspaper that is composed of articles that complement each other and provides a reading flow that matches the need for tablet computers.

The paper is produced under the Department of Informatics and Mathematical Modelling at the Technical University of Denmark and it will presume some knowledge of Constraint Programming as it will include an application that makes use of techniques from this field. The preconditions for the paper are the courses 02817 Personalization and Metadata Models and 02156 Formal Logical Systems taught at the Technical University of Denmark.
