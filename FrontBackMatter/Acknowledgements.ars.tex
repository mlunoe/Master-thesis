\chapter*{Acknowledgements}

I wish first of all to thank my family and friends for great support and for review of the paper. Without their support I would not have come as far as I hoped. I would also like to thank my counsellors, Michael Kai Petersen and Carsten Witt from the Department of Informatics and Mathematical Modelling at the Technical University of Denmark, for giving me room for my own definition of the project. They have both been a great aid in the process with guidance and review of the paper.

%Finally, a special thanks to Jens for odd discussions and help in the process, Bo and Niklas for assistance with their knowledge, Ditte for the help and review and my brother and father for all the support.
