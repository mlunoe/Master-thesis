\chapter{Abstract}

%The thesis establishes the theory of Constraint Programming (CP) and playlists. It applies techniques of CP, logic and functional programming with a similarity function between music pieces to build an Automatic Playlist Generator. The product of the thesis is a program in SML that generates playlists from a users query of suggestions and bans of songs. The similarity function is build solely on measures in tempo and key, which results in playlists that are somewhat useless. The program lack of measures in timbre, rhythm and melody, but is left open for the implementation of these. The thesis finally concludes that the techniques of CP and local search proves efficient for solving the problem.
